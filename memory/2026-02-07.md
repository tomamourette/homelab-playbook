# 2026-02-07 - Media Center Pipeline Validation Success

## Summary
Completed the validation of the Media Center pipeline (Epic 2). All integration tests (Story 2.1 - 2.7) are now passing. This was achieved by fixing local environment issues, mapping home.arpa domains, and remediating service configurations.

## Achievements
- **Environment Fix:** Increased WSL RAM to 20GB and Swap to 16GB; enabled systemd.
- **Service Mapping:** Configured `/etc/hosts` to resolve `*.home.arpa` services.
- **Radarr Fix:** Remediated IPTorrents indexer (was disabled) via API.
- **Plex Fix:** Remediated Overseerr-Plex library synchronization.
- **Test Alignment:** Updated `pytest` suites to match container-internal paths (`/data/movies` vs `/media/movies`).
- **Full Green Suite:** Verified all tests in `tests/pipeline/`, including end-to-end dry runs.

## Current Status
- Epic 2 (Pipeline Validation) is **100% Complete**.
- Environment is stable for further Claude CLI delegation.

## Next Steps
- Begin **Epic 1: Configuration Drift Discovery & Remediation**.
- Story 1.1: Setup SSH Connection & Docker Inspection tooling.
