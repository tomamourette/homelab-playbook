# 2026-02-08 - Drift Detection Initialization & Environment Stability

## Summary
Environment remains stable with 20GB RAM/16GB Swap. Successfully performed the first automated drift detection run between the running infrastructure (`ct-media-01`) and the git repositories (`homelab-apps`, `homelab-infra`).

## Achievements
- **Drift Discovery:** Ran `tools/drift-detection/drift_detect.py` successfully via SSH-agent using the dedicated `homelab-drift-detection` key.
- **Audit Results:** Analyzed 26 services. Detected drift in all 26 (mostly functional/cosmetic path differences).
- **Critical Mismatches:** Identified 2 services with BREAKING drift (likely image tag or critical env var mismatches).
- **Report Generated:** Full audit report saved to `reports/drift-2026-02-08T12-44-53.md`.

## Current Status
- Epic 2 (Pipeline Validation) is **100% Complete**.
- Epic 1 (Drift Discovery) Story 1.1 - 1.4 are functionally validated.
- Environment is ready for remediation (Story 1.5).

## Next Steps
- **Remediation:** Begin Story 1.5: Pull Request Generation for Drift Remediation.
- **Sync:** Larry to review the generated drift report in `reports/`.
