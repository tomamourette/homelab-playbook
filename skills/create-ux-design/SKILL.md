# Create UX Design

**Phase:** 2 — Planning | **Agent:** UX (Sally) | **Model:** Gemini Pro (local) | **Cost:** $0

## When to Use

Design the user experience for features that have a UI component (dashboards, web interfaces, APIs).

## Prerequisites

- PRD should exist

## Execution

Handle locally on Gemini Pro.

1. Read the PRD to understand user personas and requirements
2. Create UX design covering:
   - **User flows:** Step-by-step paths through the feature
   - **Wireframes:** Text-based layout descriptions (ASCII or structured markdown)
   - **API design:** Endpoint structure if building an API
   - **Dashboard layout:** Widget placement, data display priorities
   - **Error states:** What users see when things go wrong
   - **Accessibility notes:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader considerations
3. Write to `docs/ux-design.md`

## Output

A UX design document that informs the architecture and implementation.
