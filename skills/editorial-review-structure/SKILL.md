   - **Heading hierarchy:** Is the H1/H2/H3 structure logical?
   - **Cross-references:** Are links valid? Are related docs referenced?
   - **Template compliance:** Does it follow the project's doc templates?
   - **Missing sections:** What should be added?
3. Provide specific structural recommendations
